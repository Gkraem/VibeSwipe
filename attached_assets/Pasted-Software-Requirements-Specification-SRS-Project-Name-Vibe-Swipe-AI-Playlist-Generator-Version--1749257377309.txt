Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
Project Name: Vibe Swipe — AI Playlist Generator
Version: 1.0
Last Updated: June 6, 2025
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop Vibe Swipe, an AI-powered playlist generator that creates hyper-personalized music playlists using conversational input, emotional cues, and real-time user data from Spotify or Apple Music. The application combines a ChatGPT-style interface with a swipe-based music discovery experience to revolutionize how users curate playlists based on mood, events, or creative scenarios.

1.2 Scope
Vibe Swipe will allow users to:

Log in using Spotify or Apple Music via OAuth

Input natural language prompts to describe desired playlists

Receive smart song suggestions using AI-curated emotional, contextual, and tempo analysis

Swipe through music cards to approve or skip songs

Generate playlists based on swiped selections

(In the future) Export curated playlists directly to Spotify or Apple Music

The application will emphasize a sleek, modern, responsive design, using cutting-edge UI elements like swipe cards, light/dark modes, fluid transitions, and minimalist navigation.
